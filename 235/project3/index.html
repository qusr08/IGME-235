        <h1>Description</h1>
        <p>In this game, you use the white chess pieces to try and take out the opposing black pieces on a randomly generated chess board. Check out the about page <a href="about.html">here</a> for more information about the game.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="info-section">
        <h1>Instructions / Controls</h1>
        <p>Place your piece anywhere on the board to start. Hover over a piece to see all of its available moves.
            <br><br>Press F12 to open the console to see which turn it is (for now). The game starts as your turn. To move your piece, click it and then move it to another space. You want to move your piece onto the black pieces to destroy them.
            <br><br>Once you move your piece, the opposing side will automatically move. As of now, there is no movement AI for the other side so it just picks a random piece and moves it to a random tile.
            <br><br>Get rid of all the black pieces to win! If your white queen gets captured, you lose!
            <br><br>Refresh the page to restart the game.

        <h1>Known Bugs</h1>
        <p>
            These bugs are some of that I have observed while testing, and I definitely plan to fix for the final project. As of right now, I am still trying to figure out how to best do the logic for moving each of the pieces, which is the cause of most of the bugs/errors.
            <br><br> - When a black piece moves into the available tiles of a white piece while it is selected, the highlighted tiles do not update properly.
