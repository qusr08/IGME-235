            <p>My name is Frank Alfano and I am a game developer! I have been programming video games since I was in 5th grade and love to work with math and computers. I like all aspects of game design, but programming is definitely my strongest skill.
                I have been using Unity and C# to make most of my games, but I also know Java and Python as well as HTML, CSS, and Javascript for web development. My dream job would be to eventually get my own game studio off the ground, but any game
                where I'm working on games would be fine with me. I want people to enjoy themselves and have fun, and video games are a way for me to do that.
                <br><br> Other than computers, I like to ride my bike and enjoy the outdoors as much as possible. Also, I find space to be particularly interesting, so stargazing is another fun thing to do.</p>
