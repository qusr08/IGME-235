                <h1>I want people to have fun and enjoy themselves. Developing games is a way for me to do that.</h1>
                <p>
                    My name is Frank Alfano and I am a game developer! I have been programming since I was in 5th grade, and have mainly worked with Unity and C#. I find programming video games to be very relaxing and rewarding, so most of my free time is spent learning
                    and working on personal projects. When I'm not developing, I am riding my bike or just enjoying the outdoors.

                    Collab is a game I made by myself in the span of about 2 months. It's a 2 player puzzle platforming game where both players need to work together to solve puzzles. It is the first "complete" game that I have made, or at least one with more than 30 minutes
                    of gameplay and a good deal of polish. Even though this game isn't that special on the outside, it still holds a nice place in my mind.<br><br>I used Unity and C# to make this game, along with paint.NET for the
                    art. I recommend checking out the Github page if you are interested in learning about the mechanics!</p>
