        <p>
            My current portfolio goal is to showcase all of the personal projects that I have worked on, as well as obviously help me find a job. I do a lot of personal work and, now that I know how to build a website, I can finally have all of it displayed in one
            place. I love most of the aspects of designing games but I am definitely the most adept at programming. So, as for an audience, any company that develops games that is in need of programmers I would want to view my work.
            <br><br>When I was designing the layout of the site, I really want to put a lot of emphasis on the projects I have done. I went through a lot of different versions with the layout of the project information before I got to the point it is
            currently at. While I'm still not 100% sold on the design I have right now, I think it works and makes sense. Below are 2 sketches I made before designing the website. Sloppy, I know, but it got the point across to me at least about what the
            website was going to look like. Drawing the website out like this really does make it easier to make the layout, thought. I felt like I had a pretty easy time of trying to mimic what I drew rather than just slapping a layout together and tweaking
            it as I went.
            <!-- Images of design sketches -->
            <!-- I put inline formatting because I didn't want to have to make an entirely new stylesheet just for this documentation file -->
            <div style="display: flex; flex-flow: row nowrap; justify-content: center; gap:10px;">
                <img style="width:50%; height: 50%; border:5px solid #FF4C29; border-radius: 10px;" src="media/page-design-1.jpg" alt="">
                <img style="width:50%; height: 50%; border:5px solid #FF4C29; border-radius: 10px;" src="media/page-design-2.jpg" alt="">
            </div> In the future I would definitely add all of the projects I have worked on, as well as some links to Github repositories of mini-projects that don 't warrent their own project section. Also, embeds of the games would be nice too. Most
            of the games that I have made so far unfortunately run at like 2 FPS when in a web browser, so I need to figure out a way to make that work.
