                Description:
            </h3>

            <p>
                In the co-operative trick-taking game <em>The Crew: The Quest for Planet Nine</em>, the players set out
                as
                astronauts on an uncertain space adventure. What about the rumors about the unknown planet about? The
                eventful journey through space extends over 50 exciting missions. But this game can only be defeated by
                meeting common individual tasks of each player. In order to meet the varied challenges, communication is
                essential in the team. But this is more difficult than expected in space.
                <br><br>
                With each mission, the game becomes more difficult. After each mission, the game can be paused and
                continued later. During each mission, it is not the amount of tricks, but the right tricks at the right
                time that count.
                <br><br>
                The team completes a mission only if every single player is successful in fulfilling their tasks.
                <br><br>
                The game comes with 50 missions, with three additional missions published in spielbox 2/2020.

                Featured Review
            </h3>

            <blockquote>
                "Trick-taking has been one of my least favorite mechanisms in games, though I have played very few. When
                I played The Crew it changed my mind on the mechanic due to its unique twist of its cooperative and
                mission nature. I don't know what it is about this game, but it is extremely laid back and fun. Perhaps
                it is because each trick is a mission, so stopping at any point is easy, and jumping in and out is even
                easier.
                <br><br>
                Another reason this game is so fun is giving players at the table a hard time when they make horrible
                plays and laughing at each-other and yourself, and the reward when failing a mission several times just
                to finally complete it."
