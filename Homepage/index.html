            Hi! Iâ€™m a 2nd year Game Design and Development student from New Jersey.
            <br><br>I really like to program and do math, so I spend a lot of my time doing exactly that. I would love to be able to develop indie games as a full time job, and I have a goal to develop a game and put it on Steam by the end of 2021! Whether
            or not that deadline is met is still up for debate.
            <br><br>Other things I like to do is play video games, ride my bike, and stargaze. Favorite video games are Rocket League, Minecraft, and Fez.
